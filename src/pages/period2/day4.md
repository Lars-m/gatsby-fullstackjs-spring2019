title: "An introduction to NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose"
period: "Flow-2"
date: "12-03-2019"
pageintro: | 
   A quick intro to NoSQL. We will focus only on document database and more specifically use.

   MongoDB with Mongoose as a layer between your code and the DB (somehow similar to what you know with JPA).

---

### Before this lesson you should:
I don't plan to talk about NoSQL in general, since _Martin Fowler_ does it a lot better than me. Watch the video given below, either before or afther the lesson. It covers all "general learning goals" related to NoSQL

Normally I would always recommend a local database for development. Since however, we only have limited time for this topic, I suggest you create a free account on mlab.com as outlined [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#Setting_up_the_MongoDB_database), and use this account for all exercises related to MongoDB and Mongoose.
